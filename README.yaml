# Short description of this project
description: |-

  This is an example skeleton to provide all the scaffolding for a typical
  well-built gpops Terraform module. It's a template repository you can use
  when creating new repositories. This is not a useful module by itself.


# How to use this project
usage: |-
  1. Use this repo as a template for a new repo.
  2. Run `github/init/context.tf` to update the `context.tf` file.
  3. Replace the Terraform code at the root of the repo with the code you want to publish.
     Please keep `context.tf` in place.
  4. Run `make lint` to check your code for errors and warnings.
  5. Edit README.yaml and fill out all the information for your module
  6. Run `make readme` to create the README.md
